# Cohorts in profile #

![](docs/Splash.png?raw=true)

Cohorts in profile is a plugin that allows us to view the manually added users of cohorts. 
If we have permission to edit the cohorts, they appear as clickable links on the users’ profile. By clicking on the 
links, we can immediately manage the cohort members. 

Cohort in profile is compatible with the [Smart Cohort](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_cnw_smartcohort) plugin. If we 
install both plugins, we are also able to view the cohorts each user belongs to based on the filtering criteria 
of Smart Cohort.
